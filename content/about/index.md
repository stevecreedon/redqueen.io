This line encapsulates the [Red Queen Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen_hypothesis) in evolutionary biology then the [Red Queen Effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/red-queen-effect) in business. Competition for survival requires continuous evolution just to stay level with your competitors. Getting ahead of the competition requires even more effort.

We're technologists experienced in Data, Machine Learning, Information Security & [Software delivery](/categories/software-delivery/) and we're interested in how machines can ***remove the busy fool*** from day-to-day working life so people can be more creative moving forward. We have a bottom-up people & team focus that's as applicable to an independent high street shop as it is a team within an international corporate. 

We're sure you'll find something useful here but if you don't then please [feel free to ask](/contact).
